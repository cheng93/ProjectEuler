# Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle&emsp; &emsp; $T_n=n(n+1)/2$ &emsp; 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...  
Pentagonal&emsp;$P_n=n(3n−1)/2$&emsp;1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...  
Hexagonal&emsp;$H_n=n(2n−1)$&emsp; &emsp;1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
