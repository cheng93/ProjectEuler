# Combinatoric selections

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, ${5 \choose 3} = 10$.

In general, ${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where , $r \leq n$, $n! =n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$, and $0! = 1$.

It is not until $n = 23$, that a value exceeds one-million: ${23 \choose 10} = 1144066$.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of ${n \choose r}$
for $1 \leq n \leq 100$, are greater than one-million?
