# Number spiral diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

__21__ 22 23 24 __25__  
20  __07__  08  __09__ 10  
19  06  __01__  02 11  
18  __05__  04  __03__ 12  
__17__ 16 15 14 __13__  

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
