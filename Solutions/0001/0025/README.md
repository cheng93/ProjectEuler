# 1000-digit Fibonacci number

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$$F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}, where F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1$$

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

$F_1 = 1$  
$F_2 = 2$  
$F_3 = 3$  
$F_4 = 5$  
$F_5 = 8$  
$F_6 = 13$  
$F_7 = 21$  
$F_8 = 34$  
$F_9 = 45$  
$F_{10} = 55$  
$F_{11} = 89$  
$F_{12} = 144$

The 12th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
